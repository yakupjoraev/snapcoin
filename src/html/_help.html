                <div class="content__text">Network load is the set of transactions in a blockchain that are waiting to
                  be confirmed due to low fees, increased load and other factors. The system is kept running by miners,
                  who use processing power to process transactions and find the necessary hash for the transaction.
                  Transactions with a higher commission are processed first, then miners are accepted for transactions
                  with a lower premium. That's how the queue is formed, with the more profitable transactions in the
                  "head" and the payments with the minimum premium in the "tail".
                  If the sender needs a fast transfer, he sets a higher premium, which ensures that the transaction is
                  included in the block without delays. With savings on fees, a new transaction can take up to 3 days or
                  more.
                  When you create a request on our website, you will be able to see the recommended network fee. This
                  commission will increase the chance of a transaction being confirmed soon.</div>

                <div class="content__text">MEMO is a special identifier used in XRP transactions. In Stellar, the target
                  tag is called memo. Many services, including Freewallet, have one XRP and XLM address for all
                  customers. The only difference is a special set of numbers, called a destination tag, unique to each
                  user. When you are asked to enter a tag or note, do not ignore this action! Otherwise, your funds will
                  be lost and sent to the general balance of the platform, but not to your account. Imagine the tag as
                  the number of your house on a long street. You need to know the exact building number in order for the
                  package to reach its final destination. The same goes for these coins.
                  If you use a personal wallet, using TAG or MEMO is optional. In case you deposit funds on the
                  exchange, TAG or MEMO is mandatory.</div>

                    sent to the wrong details, a refund is not possible. We recommend that you carefully verify the
                    correctness of the data you specify;</p>

                  <p>2. Check if funds have been debited from your account. If we do not see the transfer of funds from
                    you, then the application will be deleted.</p>

                  <p>3. In rare cases, it is possible to change the time of the transfer by the bank or the payment
                    system.
                    In this situation, you can contact us in technical support or technical support of the payment
